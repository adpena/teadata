## üöÄ Quick Start

Getting started is straightforward. First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adpena/teadata.git
cd teadata
```

Then, install the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Next, import the library and initialize the engine:

```python
from teadata import DataEngine

# Initialize the engine directly from cache for instant access
engine = DataEngine()

# Quickly retrieve a district by its unique number
aldine = engine.get_district("101902")
print(aldine.name)                   # Aldine ISD
print(aldine.overall_rating_2025)   # Access enriched accountability rating instantly

# Iterate through all campuses within the district effortlessly
for campus in aldine.campuses:
    print(campus.name, campus.rating)
```

This setup avoids unnecessary data wrangling and lets you focus on analysis immediately.

## üìä Models

At the heart of the TEA Data Engine are two rich, spatially-aware models designed to mirror the real world:

### `District`

A `District` represents a Texas school district with comprehensive attributes:

- **Unique ID & District Number**: Normalized identifiers including zero-padding for consistency.
- **Name & Enrollment**: Key demographic and identifying info.
- **Type**: Classifies the district (e.g., charter, traditional ISD).
- **Ratings**: Both canonical and dynamically enriched ratings like `overall_rating_2025`.
- **Spatial Geometry**: Precise district boundaries enabling advanced geospatial queries.

The `District` class is packed with powerful behaviors:

- `.campuses`: Fetch all campuses within the district boundary with a simple attribute access.
- `.nearest_campuses()`: Perform location-based queries to find closest campuses, supporting proximity analyses.
- `.enrich()`: Dynamically attach new attributes from external datasets, allowing your data to evolve seamlessly.

### `Campus`

Each `Campus` is modeled with equal richness:

- **Unique ID & Campus Number**: Normalized to the official nine-digit TEA format.
- **Name, Enrollment, Type**: Core descriptive attributes.
- **Ratings**: Access canonical or enriched ratings effortlessly.
- **Spatial Geometry**: Precise campus location points for spatial analysis.

Campus objects link back to their parent district through `.district`, enabling easy navigation across hierarchical data.

Both models are designed to be extensible and dynamic, supporting complex workflows without sacrificing clarity or performance.

## üß† Why Object-Oriented?

The TEA Data Engine leverages Python‚Äôs OOP principles to deliver a developer-friendly, highly expressive API that feels natural and intuitive.

### Dynamic Attributes & Enrichment

Forget rigid schemas or cumbersome joins. The engine‚Äôs enrichment system lets you **inject new attributes on the fly**, turning raw datasets into rich, multidimensional objects:

```python
print(district.overall_rating_2025)   # Seamless access to enriched accountability data
print(campus.finance_per_pupil)       # Instantly available finance metrics
```

This dynamic enrichment means your analyses can evolve as new datasets arrive, without rewriting core logic or managing complex merges.

### Operator Overloading for Natural Comparisons

Districts and campuses implement Python‚Äôs comparison operators based on meaningful attributes like enrollment or ratings, enabling elegant and readable code:

```python
if campus1.enrollment > campus2.enrollment:
    print(f"{campus1.name} has more students than {campus2.name}")

if district1.rating == 'A' and district2.rating != 'A':
    print(f"{district1.name} outperforms {district2.name}")
```

This reduces boilerplate and lets you write code that reads like plain English, enhancing maintainability and reducing errors.

### Query Chaining with the `>>` Operator

One of the toolkit‚Äôs coolest features is the **`>>` operator**, which enables **fluent query chaining** to compose filters, transformations, and traversals in a clean, pipeline style:

```python
# From a district, retrieve campuses, then filter by rating 'A'
top_campuses = aldine >> 'campuses' >> (lambda c: c.rating == 'A')
for campus in top_campuses:
    print(campus.name, campus.rating)

# Chain multiple filters: campuses with enrollment > 500 and rating 'B' or better
filtered = aldine >> 'campuses' >> (lambda c: c.enrollment > 500) >> (lambda c: c.rating in ['A', 'B'])
```

This expressive syntax dramatically simplifies complex queries, eliminating nested loops or intermediate variables. It encourages concise, readable code that scales naturally as your analysis grows.

## üåç Spatial Power

Every district and campus object includes detailed geospatial data, unlocking a world of location-based insights:

- **Boundary Lookups**: Easily find all charter campuses inside a district with a simple filter.
- **Campus-in-District Matching**: Determine which district a campus belongs to based on spatial containment.
- **Proximity Queries**: Find the nearest campuses to any coordinate, enabling targeted outreach or resource planning.

```python
aldine = engine.get_district("101902")
print(f"{aldine.name} has {len(aldine.campuses)} campuses")

nearest = engine.nearest_campuses(lon=-95.37, lat=29.76, k=5)
for campus, distance in nearest:
    print(f"{campus.name} is {distance:.1f} meters away")
```

Spatial operations are seamlessly integrated into the data model, so you can conduct advanced geospatial analyses without external GIS tools or complicated workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Enrichment System

The enrichment system is a game-changer, letting you wire in external datasets from configuration files like `teadata_sources.yaml` and `teadata_config.py` with minimal effort.

- **Dynamic Attribute Injection**: Add new data fields like accountability ratings, finance metrics, or demographic summaries directly onto District and Campus objects.
- **Alias Mapping**: Map enriched attributes into canonical fields (e.g., `overall_rating_2025` into `.rating`) for consistent access.
- **Cache Snapshots**: Save enriched datasets as `.pkl` snapshots for lightning-fast reloads and reproducible analyses.

This modular enrichment architecture means your data ecosystem can grow organically, supporting new research questions and deliverables without rewriting foundational code.

---

## üìñ Example Workflows

### Find all charter campuses in a district

```python
aldine = engine.get_district("101902")
for campus in aldine.campuses:
    if "CHARTER" in campus.type.upper():
        print(campus.name, campus.rating)
```

### Query nearest campuses to a coordinate

```python
nearest = engine.nearest_campuses(lon=-95.35, lat=29.85, k=3)
for campus, distance in nearest:
    print(f"{campus.name} is {distance} meters away")
```

### Enrichment example

```python
print(aldine.rating)  # canonical rating
print(aldine.overall_rating_2025)  # enriched accountability rating
```

### Complex chained query example

```python
# Campuses within Aldine ISD that are charters and have rating 'A'
charter_a_campuses = aldine >> 'campuses' \
                             >> (lambda c: "CHARTER" in c.type.upper()) \
                             >> (lambda c: c.rating == 'A')
for campus in charter_a_campuses:
    print(campus.name, campus.rating)
```

### Combining enrichment and filtering

```python
# After enriching districts with finance data, filter by per pupil spending and rating
affordable_high_rating = (engine.all_districts()
                         >> (lambda d: d.finance_per_pupil < 10000)
                         >> (lambda d: d.rating in ['A', 'B']))
for district in affordable_high_rating:
    print(district.name, district.finance_per_pupil, district.rating)
```

These examples highlight how the TEA Data Engine‚Äôs design encourages clear, concise, and powerful data exploration.
